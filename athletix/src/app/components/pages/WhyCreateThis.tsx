                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Honestly, it comes down to a bunch of reasons. The
                        biggest reason being that I wanted to become better at
                        React, NextJS, and the frontend ecosystem. I was pretty
                        comfortable with the whole stack, but I wanted to build
                        something advanced and see how well I could do.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Working on this project taught me so many new things
                        about React and NextJS. Just off the top of my head:
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            Learned how Custom hooks work in React. They&apos;re
                            soooo useful!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Learned a ton of new stuff about Docker, cos one of
                            my goals was to dockerize the whole app (frontend,
                            backend, and db)!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Become pretty comfortable using React Motion and
                            used it to create some pretty cool UX experiences.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Learned a ton of new stuff about NextJS and how I
                            can use it to better structure my apps.
                        </li>

                        And a hundred other things that I&apos;m missing here.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        The other reason was cos I&apos;m a huge gym rat, and I
                        wanted a cool dashboard app to manage my training. So I
                        basically just filled Athletix with all the features I
                        would want in a fitness app. I&apos;m pretty happy with
                        how it came out.
